-1 MOTD~
#n
Please read the following help files before playing the game :

RULES, POLICY, FORGE, BRIEF, NEWBIE, CLASS and MCCP

It is very important that you read help on WHO, PARADOX and PARADOXSTATS

Thanks, enjoy the game.

~

1 CHANGES~
These are the changes done to the stock Dystopia 1.2 code

* Nothing yet.

~

1 RULES~
1) Don't piss off or insult the immortals in any way.
2) Respect the coders.
3) If you need to talk to an immortal, you will address them
   in proper english. Use lamerspeak an get ignored.
4) Don't abuse the rules, if you think that you've found a
   smart shortcut, don't think the coders made it that way
   on purpose; report it or get deleted.
5) Read help policy and help changes often, and read all
   notes on board 3 (announcements), ignorance of the rules
   is not an excuse, and you WILL be punished for breaking them.

Don't fucking multiplay, no matter WHAT!!!...
If you abuse a bug, you abuse the mud, you abuse US!...DIE!..

~

-1 ALIAS~
The alias system.

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

By typing cc <target>, the player now casts dispel magic on that target.
To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harrash players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harrash players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harrashment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

1 WHO~

Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

Enjoy!

~

-1 RAGNAROK~
#0RAGNAROK MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Ragnarok.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if ragnarok is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing ragnarok the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during ragnarok.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
the ragnarok command. ie. 'ragnarok 200' will add 200 qps
to the ragnarok pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on ragnarok). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and ragnarok cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Ragnarok lasts 15 minutes.

Enjoy
~

1 SETLOGIN SETLOGOUT SETAVATAR SETTIE SETDECAP~
With these commands you can set the message other players gets when you enter
or leave the game, as well as train avatar. Each time you set this message,
you must pay 1000 qps.

There are certain rules that must be followed, they are rather simple though, so
you shouldn't have any trouble following them.

* No profanities in the message.
* No referring to any of the immortals or other players besides the possibly victim.
* I'll remove your ability to change your messages if you abuse this in any way.

The syntax is easy, heres a few examples :

setlogin $n draws his scimitars and prepares for battle as he enters Dystopia.
settie $n grins in triumph as $e ties up $N.

Heres the syntax :

  $n  This is your name.
  $N  This is the name of the possible victim.
  $e  Results in he/she depending on your sex.
  $E  Results in he/she depending on the victims sex.
  $m  Results in him/her depending on your sex.
  $M  Results in him/her depending on the victims sex.
  $s  Results in his/her depending on your sex.
  $S  Results in his/her depending on the victims sex.

~

1 MCCP~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n
 
Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

~

1 BRIEF4 BRIEF3 BRIEF2 BRIEF1~

With the command brief1, brief2, brief3 and brief4, you can toggle how much you'll
recieve from looking and combat.

brief1 -> Information when you look toggled between short/long.
brief2 -> Toggle shields, misses and weapon burn/freeze in combat.
brief3 -> Toggle dodge/parry messages in combat.
brief4 -> Toggle message on exp modifiers, discipline points and class points.

~

-1 NEWBIE~
#RThe Newbie Helper#n

#R*#n First kill some mobs in the newbie arena (located south of where you start, that's
  up and south from recall), when you have 2K hps, you can train avatar and use
  the selfclass command to gain a class.
#R*#n After getting a class, you should get a little buffer from killing mobs in newbie
  arena, then move on to either Elemental Canyon or The Black Dragons Lair.
  The Lair can be found 2 south, 6 east, 2 south and down from recall.
#R*#n During the first 4 hours of play you cannot be attacked by other players, and should
  use this time to get stronger, remember to get all your class powers, read the
  help file on your class and do the best you can.
#R*#n There are some help files you might want to read, since they'll help you alot.
  The list : BRIEF, EXP, MCCP, CHANGES, RULES and POLICY, they each contain knowledge
  that is useful for new players to this mud (not just newbies).
#R*#n Remember the following :
  #R*#n The higher your unarmed ability is, the less you will get hit by monsters.
  #R*#n Treat others with the same respect you would want them to show you, it will
    help you get along alot easier (Remember be nice while your small, you can always be mean later)
  #R*#n If you don't know how a thing is done, try seeing if their is a help file on the
    subject, if there isn't we could use one, and your welcome to write it and mail it the staff.

Good luck, and all that :)

~

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

~

1 POLICY~

#R* #nNo spamming any channels.
#R* #nNo exp botting
  NOTE : xp-botting is getting ANY xp while NOT typing the commands yourself.
#R* #nSpellbotting is allowed. OUTSIDE midgaard. Bot in midgaard and die.
#R* #nNo multiplaying or playersharing. (read HELP MULTIPLAYING)
#R* #nNo letting yourself be capped or genstolen.
  - So NO selling of ratio or generation.
#R* #nBe kind to newbies, being a total jerk to newbies isn't tolerated.
#R* #nPurposely CRASHING of the mud.
#R* #nIf your going to argue and bicker with someone, please use the flame
  channel, spambitching on any of the other global channels is NOT
  allowed, and you'll most likely get silenced permanently if you do so.
  This rule is enforced by the imms, and the imms will be the ones who
  decide whether this rule has been violated. Live with it.
#R* #nNo saccing claimed eq in any way.
#R* #nRead the announce board (board 3), any rulings made on that board
  counts as policy, and ignorance is not an excuse.
#R* #nIf you find some way to get around something that is not normal possibly
  without breaking the rules, you can consider it illegal.
  - Use your brain, if safeguards was made to prevent players to do certain
    things, and you find a way around it, it's a bug, don't play stupid and
    think the coders made it this way on purpose, report it instead.

#R** #nIf you don't like any or all of these rules or policies leave this site.

#R** #nThe penalty for breaking the rules is decided by the immortal that
   punishes you. Any punishment is considered fair.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G#y(actually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possibly Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

~
-1 STORY~
It is a time of great magic.  Powerful immortals battle across the world
for domination, slaying and pillaging at will.  Only the greatest can 
survive...are you one of them?
~

1 PKPOWERS~
 
Pkpowers are special powers that becomes available to players as
they rise in pkscore. To see your pkscore type 'top' this will
not only show you your own score, but also show the top10 of
best players (in regard to pkscore).

The pkscore is based on your pk record (kills and deaths), and
you gain a power for each 500 points you have. You can type
'pkpower' to gain a list of powers you can use.

pkscore   power
-----------------
  500    Sanctum         -  a healing power.
 1000    Eaglesight      -  a scrying power.
 1500    Awereness       -  (auto).
 2000    Lifesense       -  a readaura power.
 2500    Supreme attack  -  (auto).
 3000    Call to Arms    -  summons help.
 3500    Objectscry      -  scry through items.
 4000    Ironmind	 -  reverse damage.
 4500    Crystalsight    -  superior sight for a while.
 5000    Silverpath      -  powerful portal.

~

1 MASTERY~

When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

0 QUESTKEY~
From now on ill put a #yQuest#RKey#n in game every day.
Keep them they are very valueable.

Do not keep them in containers, store chars, or in other ways keep them from other
players if they cap you!!

If i find you breaking ANY of those rules ill punish you.

~

0 ARENA~

The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

~

0 GENERATION GENSTEAL~

All new chars start at generation 6, and can improve their
generation by stealing generation from other chars with same
or better (lower) generation than them self.

syntax : gensteal <victim>

victim must be morted.

Generation gives a damcap bonus.

At generation 2 your max weaponskill goes up by 10%.
At generation 1 your max weaponskill goes up by 20%.

0 CASTLE~
#CYes you are right, you got your self a new castle!.#n

You say#y 'So whats new?'#n
Dracknuur says#y 'Shut up and read the note!'#n

1. Every castle got a healer/guard now, pure stock!
2. more rooms addet.
3. A entrance (no more safe hugging in castles)...:)

Now its up to you, to make the castle as you want it.
I want a description for every room in the castle, a long
and a short.

The Temple Square #R<----#CThis is a short description#n
[Exits: north east south west up]
You are standing on the temple square.  Huge marble steps lead up to the #R<----#Cthis is a long#n
temple gate.  The entrance to the Clerics Guild is to the west, and the old
Grunting Boar Inn, is to the east.  Just south of here you see the market
square, the center of Midgaard.

1 KINGDOMS~
Fill out the details on your kingdoms here :)

commands :

kstat       - lists the special stats for your own kingdom
kset        - changes the kingdom settings (king and immortals only)
kinduct     - inducts kingdom members (general and king only)
koutcast    - outcasts kingdom members (general and king only)
kingdoms    - lists all kingdoms and their stats/reqs
ktalk       - kingdom channel
wantkingdom - toggles the ability to be inducted on/off
kingset     - immortal command to set players kingdom

The kingdom code is just a coresystem, and doesn't contain much besides
the basic functionality of a kingdom. The immortals of the mud should
create the kind of kingdom they want.

~

0 SUPERSTANCES~

When you have grandmastered all you normal stances, you can create your
own stances with the setstance command. The setstance command will tell
you how to create a new stance, and how much xp it costs; but beware,
once you have finished your superstance, your stuck with it forever.
Also notice that you won't get any extra powers by chosing the same
power several times, even if you choose both lesser and greater version,
it's just a waste of xp.

Enjoy. 

~


0 UPGRADE~
Upgrading is a way to choose among some of the more powerful classes;
to upgrade you need to max your char first, then you can choose to
exchange that char for a new char of that class's upgrade class...

#RThe reqs for upgrading is #0:#n
50K hp, 35K mana, 35K move, 40K Questpoints and generation 1.

For each 100 pkscore you have less than 1000, you must pay an extra
3K in hp/move/mana to upgrade, you cannot pay more than 30K extra.

Having more than 1000 pkscore will not reduce the cost for upgrading.

When you upgrade you get set to 5K across and loose ALL class powers,
then you get your new class. You've been warned, so don't whine when
you lose all your old powers, that's just life.

It is possibly for an upgrade to improve their powers even
more, read HELP UPGRADE2 to check out the facts.

~

1 UPGRADE2~
When a player have upgrade to his new class, he/she can upgrade
again and again, though instead of losing his or her old class and
gaining a new one, they keep their class and powers, but gets set
to 5K across. In return for this, they gain additional damcap/dodge/
parry/attacks/etc.

0 LICH~
#n #n
Lichs are powerful sorceres that have cheated death by entering a state of
living death. No longer subject to the affects of time, they use their time
to explore other planes and perfect their magic. The lichs grow in power, far
beyond that of most mortal mages, since they have so much more time to perfect
their art. If you thought mages were scary, try fighting a lich that has used
the last 2000 years comming up with nasty spells to kill and destroy.

Masters of conjuring, death, life, necromantics and chaos, lichs have
acces to several powers, some of them are know as :

Conjuring   : Objectgate, Fireball, Planartravel, Golemsummon, Pentagram.

~

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>
Syntax: call all
Syntax: gift <object> <player>
Syntax: locate

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.

It should be noted that relics CANNOT be gifted.

~



0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce ( 1/4th of their exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even crack the skull and eat their brains ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>
~



0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~



0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~



0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~



0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~



0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~



0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~



0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~



0 EXPERIENCE XP~
#n #n
Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the level of the mob being killed.
There are also different modifiers like happy hour and newbie exp.

The exp modifiers are as listed :

* Newbie hours (The first 4 hours) : gives 200 % extra exp.
* Happy (Immortals can set this)   : gives 100 % extra exp.
* Pkscore (only positive value)    : gives   1 % for each 50 pkscore.
* Tithe (worshippers only)         : gives  -5 % exp (that's less)
* Mccp   (read Help mccp)          : gives  25 % extra exp.
* Alignment (explained below)      : gives +/- 25% extra exp.

#GAlignment explaned#n
If your kill a mob of the opposite alignment as yourself, fx. if your
aligned good and you kill an evil mob, you gain 25% extra exp from
the kill. BUT if your the same alignment as the mob you get 25% LESS
exp from killing that mob.

#GGuidelines about modifiers#n
* DO NOT ask immortals to turn on Happy Hour!
* Use #ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #yANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

7 PFILE~
Jope is an online pfile editor, which makes it possibly to edit
pfiles without having shell access. Which parts of a pfile that
can be editted depends on the immortals level, and it's quite
easy to change these settings (and add more editable data) in
the file 'jope.c'.

can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~



0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.


f these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a

armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 ANSI COLOUR~
Syntax: ansi

This will show things in colour.  Spells will appear in their appropriate 
colour, and important messages will be highlighted.  Your exp (or opponents
condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
Scaled colour is represented as follows:

New scale.

#7White = Under 0%
#gDark Green = 0%
#n(In Between)
#pPink
#PMagenta
#oBrown
#rDark Red
#3Yellow
#u-------#n
#2Light Green = 100%+#n

Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.
~

0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE~
Syntax: note list
Syntax: note read    <number>

at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

~

0 PRIMAL~

Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana,

between 1 and 50 points).

to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store

1 WARPS~

All warps are automatic, so you don't need any commands to activate them, just the command
obtain to get new warps. Theres a total of 18 warps, some have an affect, others don't.

These are the possibly warps :

Your body is protected by a indestructable crystal shell.
Your skin is as hard as steel.
Your arms are incredibly strong.
Your legs are incredibly strong.
Your tongue is long and venomous.
Your tail fires deadly spikes during combat.
Your breath is putrid and deadly.
You have incredible speed.
You have increased stamina, reducing the damage you take.
Your heightened senses enable you to hunt people. (*)
You have the ability to devour your opponents, sending them into the pits of Hell. (*)
Your features are so horrid that they may stun those who look at you. (*)
Your body has the ability to regenerate incredibly fast.
Your mounts transform into hideous Demons. (use the mount spell)
You have the power to transform into a deadly battle axe. (*)
Your body is composed of deadly magma.
Your skin is covered with shards of ice.
A pair of leathery wings protrude from your back.

The warps with (*) doesn't have any affect, and some of the warps are
used together with inparts or disciplines, most are just extra attacks
in combat or extra toughnes.

Maybe some day when I have some spare time, I'll clean up the demon powers,
but currently you'll just have to live with the mess.

0 SAMURAI~
The Samurai is an ancient warrior and master of armed combat. 
A samurai must train for a long time before his true potential can
be released. Once he has masterd the fighting weapons however, few 
can stand up to such power. Also the samurai is protected from most 
magiks by the spirits of the ancestors. Beware, the samurai may appear
as only mortal, but much power resides in these warriros of old.

0 SAMURAICOMBO~
During combat a samurai can use four different attack forms, each will
affect the samurais focus a bit.

Slide         1 point
Sidestep      2 points
Block         4 points
Countermove   8 points

When the samurais focus hits 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35 he or she will
be allowed to make a special attack (auto).

When not fighting the counter will slowly drop, while fighting, the
samurai can use the focus command to make it drop.

The focus counter can be added to the samurais prompt with the %k

claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

Using the Celerity Discipline allows a vampire to move extremely quickly 
and have extra attacks in the same round.
~

0 FORTITUDE~

Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping
the weapons from harming them at all.
~

0 POTENCE~

This Discipline defines the superior strength that vampires often 
possess.  This physical might allows the user to inflict much larger 
amounts of damage in combat than normal.
~

0 OBFUSCATE~

Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rMask#n Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.

the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

<<*>> #rShadowsight#n This power allows you to see in the Umbra.
<<*>> #rNightSight#n This power allows the kindred to see in the dark.
<<*>> #rShadowstep#n This allows you to step through the umbra without
      being seen and appear in front of your victim.
<<*>> #rLamprey#n This powerful ability allows you to shoot tendrils
      at your victim entraping them.
~

0 SERPENTIS~

Serpentis is the art of temptation and corruption.  Vampires with this 
Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run 
their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.

      immune to being staked.

the minds and actions of others.  Dominate is an aspect of the power of 
the mind and the will.

      to obey. This will only work on those who's minds are much weaker than 
      the vampire's.

<<*>> #rMesmerise#n This allows you to take over mobs and players.

be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

0 NINJAS~

Ninja's are warriors trained in the dark art of Ninjutsu.  They fight
using stealth and quickness making them a deadly foe.  Ninja's have few, yet
powerful powers at their disposal, and when these powers are mastered a 
ninja can be a most powerful adversary.  Through stealth a ninja can sneak
upon a victim and do a deadly amount of damage, and if this is not enough
they can slink away and hide in the shadows.  However, if you try to run
from a master ninja you shall find yourself hard pressed to make it out
alive.

It is vital for a ninja to focus his or her Ki, this is done with the command
'michi'. A ninja CANNOT regen while not in a state of michi. Ninjas are   
ranked with a system of belts. Each belt adds more punch to the ninjas
abilities in combat, meaning more damage, better dodge, more attacks, etc.
Belts can be trained with the command 'train beltX' where X is the current
belt that the ninja wish to learn.

must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.

Tornado Kick   - Strikes everyone in the room with kicks.
Choyoken       - A devastating attack that targets the opponents stamina.
