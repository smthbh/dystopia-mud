In the Courtyard.~
You are in the courtyard.  As you look around, you notice something you
never really thought of before.  The whole area is remarkably clean.  At
that moment it hits you like a ton of bricks.  You can never recall being
someplace where you couldn't at least see someone.  There are tons of people
here, from cleaners to guards.  Would this be a security measure, or is
someone lonely.

The Courtyard.~
You are in the castle courtyard.  There are huge banners lining the
castle itself.  One of them catches your eye, you think it looks something
like a hammer or maul of some sort and behind it is a barrel, or so it
looks.  They are crossed over each other in the standard manner that banners
are done.  You ponder the meaning of this strange flag.
